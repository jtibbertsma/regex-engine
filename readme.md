# Regex Engine

This is a simple regular expression engine that I wrote back during my senior year of university as a fun side project. Once upon a time, this thing actually worked, and I had lots of regex syntax implemented such as literal matches, greedy and lazy repetition, lookaheads, subexpression calls, etc.

The problem is that I wrote this before I knew how to use source control, so I broke the whole thing when I tried to implement unicode and eventually gave up because it was too tedious. (I did learn a lot about unicode, though.)

Anyway, I figured that if I'm going to brag to potential employers that I wrote my own regex engine, I should at least have it up on github. When I have time, I'll delete the unicode stuff and try to make it work again as an ascii regex engine.
